# Adv. GIS Project: Creating Statistical Figures Based on User Input

## About the Project
- This project creates statistical plots based on information provided by the user with the use of Geopandas open source and the Matplotlib library. The script is designed for users working with geodatabases and shapefiles in GIS who may want to complement their spatial anaylsis with other statistical visualizations.

## Importance of Statistics Visualization
- Identifying trends or relationships: Statistical figures help researchers observe trends or lack thereof based on discernible patterns. 
- Corroboration of findings: These data visualizations provide additional support to researchers when validating their findings (quality control).
- Communication tool for the target audience: Statistical plots are utlitized as messaging tools and are a key resource when communicating an issue to the public. 
- Simplifying complex datasets: Visualization helps to 'clean' the data, making it more concise and tangible.


## Features of the Tool
- User input-based script allows for customization of statistical figures for better visualization. 
- Options to create four statistical plots: bar graphs (vertical and horizontal), scatter plots, histograms, and box plots (single and multiple plots).
- Code provides options and information to the user in order to facilitate input.
- Produces easy-to-read figures which can be integrated into anaylsis projects.

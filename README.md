# Adv. GIS Project
---Script Objective & Work Plan---
- My main objective for my portion of the plotting project is to create statistical plots & figures based on user input.
- User will provide the geodatabase and shapefile that they're using, in addition to what specific data they would like to plot from the shapefile.
- For the desired figure, the user will also input parameters for visualization such as figure size, font size, labels, data points from the gdb/shapefile, etc.
